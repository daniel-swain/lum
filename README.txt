Hello, thanks for checking out Lumizze.

Currently, his abilities are:
- He runs faster at night!

On the long-term todo list:
- Give him immunities to certain sanity decreasing objects and creatures
- as well as slower sanity degeneration
Reasoning: He's chippy and can't be brought down so easily. And he only has a single eye.
So he can't see half the stuff that would normally make him lose sanity.

- Banana Phone - Create mod object
Explanation: He starts out with a phone shaped as a banana (perhaps a sound clip for the ringing)
Calls in bananas to be eaten. Provides health and hunger (no sanity <- That would be overpowered.)

- Pickpocket Glove - Create mod object
Explanation: He will also start out with a glove that will allow him to pickpocket enemies.
Assuming that those enemies have pockets.
